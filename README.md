Here is a revised and improved version of the README:

# Solidity-101

## Introduction

Welcome to Solidity-101, an automated workshop designed to introduce you to Solidity and smart contracts. This workshop is perfect for developers who are new to both Solidity and blockchain technology.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop consists of two main components:
- An ERC20 token with the ticker `TD-SOL-101`, which is used to track your progress in the form of points.
- A series of 15 exercises that will mint and distribute `TD-SOL-101` tokens as you complete them.

Your goal is to earn as many `TD-SOL-101` points as possible. Please note:
- You will need testnet Ether to participate. Search for "Sepolia testnet faucet" on Google to acquire some.
- The `transfer` function of the `TD-SOL-101` token has been disabled. This is to ensure you complete the workshop with a single wallet address.

## How to Get Started

### Workshop Structure

The instructions for each exercise are embedded within the respective exercise contract located in the [contracts/exercises](contracts/exercises) directory. Each exercise inherits from the [ExerciseTemplate](contracts/exerciseTemplate.sol), which contains shared logic for validating student work and distributing points.

The exercises are deployed on the Sepolia testnet, and you can interact with them through:
- [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/contracts/interact) using the provided contract ABIs from the [build/contracts](build/contracts) folder.
- [Starton](https://app.starton.com/auth/login?redirect_to=https://app.starton.com/projects) using the provided contract ABIs from the [build/contracts](build/contracts) folder.
- Alternatively, you can use Etherscan to interact with the contracts.
- If you know how to use web3 libraries, whatever the language, you can use them to interact with the contracts.

### Earning Points

To earn points, you must execute code within each smart contract to trigger the function call:
```solidity
creditStudent(n, msg.sender);
```
This function will credit you with `n` points. You can infer the expected actions by carefully reviewing the code in each exercise contract.

## Exercise Contract Addresses
